hello and welcome to our graph in pyton

we have here a few files we hope u will have fun:)

we have a fiew files here

DiGraph is the core of our graph he is build with three dictinary
1. all the nodes in the graph
2. all out edges from a node
3. all in edges from a node

we have many functions in DiGraph like:
1. add node
2. add edge
3. connect between 2 nodes
4. get all v
and more

after that we go to GraphAlgo:
here we have a few more functions we can do on a graph:
1. load from json and save to json
2. connected compounents for a spsifice node and for all the nodes in the graph
3. shortest path between two nodes
4. plot the graph using matplotlib and numpy

we also used here the dijkstra algorithm you can read about him here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm

you can run the file Ex3_main or any of the tests in the src folder to get a sence of the graph and what we did

hope u will like it and good luck:)
